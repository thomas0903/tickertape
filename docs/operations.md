# Operating a tickertape journal

Practical guidance for running a writer in production-like settings. The guarantees themselves are in
[`crash-contract.md`](crash-contract.md); measured costs are in [`benchmarks.md`](benchmarks.md). This page only
draws conclusions from those two.

## Choosing a segment size

`WriterConfig::segment_size` (default 128 MiB; a multiple of 64 KiB) trades these against each other:

- **Rolls.** The append that fills a segment publishes the next one: write and sync its header, then link it. With
  the default `prefault(true)`, the next segment has been preallocated in the background (see "Writer threads");
  otherwise the roll also preallocates and syncs a whole new file. Either way that append takes milliseconds
  instead of microseconds (see "roll appends" in `benchmarks.md`). Larger segments roll less often.
- **Largest record.** A record must fit in one segment: at most `segment_size - 112` bytes of payload.
- **Disk reservation.** Every segment reserves its full size on disk when it is created, even if it is mostly empty.
- **Open time.** When the writer opens, it reads the part of the newest segment after the last record to clean up
  after a crash, so very large segments make opening slower.
- **Granularity of archiving.** You archive or delete whole segments (below).

For most uses the default is a reasonable start. Pick smaller segments (a few MiB) for low-volume journals you
archive often, larger ones if roll latency matters and disk space doesn't.

## Writer threads

On macOS, with `WriterConfig::prefault(true)` (the default), the writer moves segment work off its own thread.
APFS makes both kinds of work expensive:

- **Page faults.** A helper thread, `tickertape-prefault`, keeps the next 8 MiB of the active segment faulted in with
  `madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)` (ADR 0020). Writing into a preallocated APFS segment otherwise faults once per 16 KiB
  page, slowly.
- **The next segment.** Once the active segment is half full, a short-lived thread, `tickertape-spare`, creates,
  preallocates and syncs `next-segment.tmp` (ADR 0022). The roll then only writes and syncs the header and links the
  file into place; preallocating and syncing a whole segment on APFS takes about 50 ms. The spare reserves one more
  segment's worth of disk space from that point on.

Neither thread ever writes records. On Linux the writer starts neither (ADR 0023). On ext4 both made latency worse:
- the prefault advice caused 100-millisecond stalls at high byte rates;
- the spare occasionally caused tens of milliseconds of stalls;
- a synchronous roll there costs only about a millisecond.

Set `prefault(false)` if you want a writer that starts no threads on macOS either.

## Choosing a checkpoint interval

`Writer::checkpoint()` makes everything appended so far durable. Until then, records are visible and survive the
writer process crashing, but not a power loss (crash contract C1, C7, C8).

- **Cost.** A checkpoint takes milliseconds (see `benchmarks.md`; on macOS it ends with two `F_FULLFSYNC` calls).
  Don't checkpoint after every record unless you need that and can afford it.
- **Exposure.** After a power loss, everything since the last successful checkpoint may be gone, and its sequence
  numbers will be reused for new records.
- **Durable-only readers** (`ReaderConfig::durable_only`, `--durable-only`) see records only once a checkpoint
  covers them, so they lag the writer by up to one checkpoint interval.
- **Recovery time.** When the writer opens, it validates everything written since the last checkpoint; a journal
  that is never checkpointed is validated from the start every time.

A common pattern is a time- or count-based checkpoint (for example every second or every N records, whichever comes
first) plus one before a clean shutdown. Dropping a `Writer` does not checkpoint.

If `checkpoint()` returns an error, the writer refuses all later checkpoints (`Error::DurabilityLost`) while appends
keep working. Treat it as an incident: see "Errors are sticky" in the crash contract.

## Disk space

Segments are never deleted automatically unless a writer retention policy is configured. Without retention or
`tickertape archive`, disk use only grows. Retention is best effort and depends on checkpoints: a writer that never
checkpoints never frees space, and the checkpoint segment and newer segments always remain.

- Monitor free space on the journal's filesystem. A failed roll returns an error for which
  `Error::is_storage_full()` is true; the journal stays consistent and the append can be retried once space is back.
- **btrfs:** on a full btrfs volume, writes into an already preallocated segment can end the writer process with
  `SIGBUS` (or block it, with copy-on-write disabled), measured in crash contract C10. Keep clear headroom there.
- **APFS:** a `checkpoint()` on a completely full volume fails with `ENOSPC`, which poisons the writer (C9).

## Archiving and deleting old segments

Use `tickertape archive` for an explicit run, or configure a writer retention policy for long-running recorders:

```sh
# Inspect the plan, then move old segments into an existing archive directory.
tickertape archive ./journal --to ./archive --keep-segments 10 --dry-run
tickertape archive ./journal --to ./archive --keep-segments 10
# Or permanently delete a sealed prefix older than 30 days.
tickertape archive ./journal --delete --older-than 30d
```

```rust
use tickertape::{WriterConfig, retention::{Action, Policy}};
let config = WriterConfig::default().retention(
    Policy::default().max_segments(10).max_bytes(1024 * 1024 * 1024),
    Action::Delete,
);
```

The writer runs retention once after recovery on open and after every successful checkpoint. Retention errors
never fail open, append or checkpoint and never poison the writer. Check `Writer::last_retention_error()` for the
most recent error (retained even after later successes), and `Writer::retention_report()` for cumulative counts,
including removals completed before a subsequent failure. Neither is part of the recovery report.

The same rules apply to the library and CLI, without taking the writer lock:

- Remove **from the oldest end only**, stopping at the first ineligible segment or failure. Never skip a file or
  remove a middle segment, since that leaves a gap in the chain.
- Only sealed segments **strictly older than the checkpoint segment** qualify. Without a valid checkpoint marker
  nothing is eligible; a dangling marker is an error. Never remove the marker's segment or anything newer.
- Limits combine with OR: keep at most N total segments, at most B total segment file bytes, or remove segments
  sealed longer ago than D. Seal time is the successor header's creation time, not file modification time.
  Counts and bytes include the active segment. Checkpoint eligibility can prevent reaching the requested limit.
- Moves preserve the segment basename and require an existing destination directory. Same-filesystem moves use
  an atomic no-replace rename. `EXDEV` selects copy, sync the copy, sync the destination directory, remove the
  source, sync the journal directory. Existing files (including symlinks and identical copies) are errors.

An interrupted cross-filesystem move can leave an original, a copy, or both; a partial copy never permits source
removal. On retry, an existing destination remains a conflict. Inspect it and explicitly resolve the conflict
(or choose a fresh destination) before rerunning; tickertape never overwrites it. Completed earlier removals stay
in effect if a later segment fails. A concurrent archiver's missing segment is treated as already removed only
when it was at the oldest end. `retention::apply` revalidates plans against the current journal before removal.
Segments are ordinary files named after their first sequence number (`00000000000000001234.tape`); you can also
copy sealed segments without changing the journal.

Readers that are still inside a segment you delete keep reading it (they hold the file open), but when they reach
its end they return `Error::Discarded`, because the file is gone; seek to their position to continue
(`tickertape tail` does this automatically). Readers positioned before the oldest remaining segment get
`Error::SeqUnavailable` from `seek`. `Reader::open` starts at the oldest segment that exists.

Never truncate or edit a segment in place while anything uses the journal: processes that map it can receive
`SIGBUS`.

## Checking a journal

- `tickertape verify <dir>` checks every header, record and seal and exits with code 2 if anything is wrong; it is
  read-only and safe to run while the writer is active.
- `tickertape inspect <dir>` lists segments, their sequence ranges and fill level, and the checkpoint marker.

## After a crash

- **Writer process crash:** just start the writer again. It cleans up a partly written record and continues with the
  next sequence number (C1–C4). Its `recovery_report()` lists what it did; after a plain process crash it contains at
  most a zeroed uncommitted tail, a completed seal or roll, and removed temporary files.
- **Power loss or storage errors:** the writer validates the journal from the last checkpoint. Corrupt or
  disconnected data is moved to `quarantine/` (never deleted), or, with `RecoveryPolicy::Fail`, the writer refuses to
  open so that a human can look first. Readers that had seen discarded records get `Error::Discarded`.
- **Refused to open** (missing checkpoint segment or a gap in the chain): restore the missing segments from a copy,
  or move the affected segments aside knowingly. tickertape won't discard history on its own.

The `quarantine/` directory is never cleaned up by tickertape; inspect it and delete it yourself when you're done.
